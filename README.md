# TikTokShop
Our team has implemented a wishlist function to TikTok Shop to drive traffic and increase number of users for TikTok Shop

We have coded two different paths to illustrate the user interface:

  PATH A:
  1. From mainpage.php, you can click on the item you wish to purchase (pants), which redicts to item.php
  2. On item.php, you can click on size which redirects to item_size.php
  3. On item_size,php, you can click on the wishlist icon (star) and redirects to cart.php which contains the wishlist
  4. From item.php or item_size.php, clicking on the wishlist icon (star) also redirects to cart.php

  PATH B:
  1. From friend.php, you can click on the wishlist icon (star) which redirects to friend_cart.php
  2. On friend_cart.php, you can see the items in your friend's wishlist
